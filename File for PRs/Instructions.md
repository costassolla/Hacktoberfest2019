> Welcome to Karamel2002/Hacktoberfest2019/File for PRs
# ***Here are some simple steps***
## **CREATING NEW FILE**
### 1. *"Create new file"*
### 2. Name your file (eg. *Example.cpp*)
### 3. Inputs and Outputs are optional, but I would recommend the program to print an output: "Hello World!"
### 4. On *"Commit new file"*:
- Description is optional
- Put a tick on "*Create a new branch for this commit and start a pull request. Learn more about pull requests.*" 
- Give your branch a name (eg. Karamel2002-patch-1 *(this is the default name though :)*)
### 5. "Propose new file"

## **OPEN A PULL REQUEST**
### 1. Give your **Pull request** a title (eg. Karamel2002's PR)
### 2. "Create a pull request"

## **LAST STEP!!**
### After completing all steps above, your contributions will be counted on your Hacktoberfest Profile at *[YOUR PROFILE](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/profile)*
### I will review and merge your pull request to the file ASAP.

## ***BEFORE YOU LEAVE:*** My name is Karamel and thank you for choosing my respository for Hacktoberfest 2019! Hope you will enjoy this event 💓
